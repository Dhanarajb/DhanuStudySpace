            <p>
                Hi, I'm Dhanaraj, a software developer with 2.8 years of experience at Cisco and GE Healthcare. I hold an MS degree and specialize in ReactJS, JavaScript, and various front-end technologies. I've successfully transitioned projects from Angular to React, built AI-powered tools, and optimized high-traffic APIs. I'm passionate about creating intuitive and high-performing applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm dedicated to continuous learning and improving my skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active at the gym and exploring new technologies. Currently, I'm focused on developing a dashboard for Cisco Spaces and expanding my expertise in DSA and design principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to connect with me for collaborations or opportunities!
